description: What I use most of my time

So, crawling around the web I found that lots of programming blogs used to describe their workspace in 7 items because of a meme. This is my attempt at doing so as well.

## OS X

I just recently got on to OS X. I'm glad I did. I have been using Linux + Windows + FreeBSD in my desktop for years by now in a Quad-Boot environment: ElementaryOS, Arch Linux, FreeBSD and Windows 7. 

I started getting down the \*nix OS road with Ubuntu, a very *user friendly* distro and one of its biggest strengths. Then I discovered eOS and got into some more heavy drugs like Arch and FreeBSD. From there the road just keep getting steeper, you learn that someday out of the blue the X11 stopped and there goes one day of reading how to fix it, until you get tired and just reinstall it altogether. That doesn't occurs on OS X, everything is there, and it just works, you close your laptop, open it again, and that's it.


## Firefox

One browser to rule them all. 

Yes, Firefox is definitely the best browser out there, not only because of its add-ons but *also* because of its add-ons. They give you the ability to change *everything* in there. I use [Tab Mix Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-mix-plus/) add-on, so I can have 3 rows of tabs, and that's very important for me, that usually have about 600+ tabs opened - by the time of this writing I had 368 tabs opened. And, of course, there's no way that such petty browsers like chrome could support that many tabs. FF Rocks!

I also use [VimFX](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimfx/), a very good vim key mapper. I gave [Pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/nightlies) a try, but after spending a day to configure it, I realised that I just made it equal to VimFX, then decided to just stick with VimFX. And [lots](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/context-search-x/) [of](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/) [more](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/s3menu-wizard/) [that](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/regex-find/) [I](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-tools/) [use](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-app/).


## Visual-Novel Folder

I'm a huge addict of VNs. They're just the best. I mean, there has been very few games that could begin to entertain me. Most games are just *boring*. However, to sit in a chair for hours straight, doing nothing but reading some text with music while some images change on the background is, *surprisingly*, **not boring**.

And I mean it, after playing Muv-Luv for 100+ hours, Fate Stay/Night for 120+ hours, Clannad for i-dont-even-remember-anymore+ hours, I can guarantee its effectiveness in sucking the user in the story. [Here](https://vndb.org/u48551/list?c=all;v=0;t=-1;o=d;s=vote) you can see a list of my most prized VNs.


## Git

My VCS of choice. 

After being forced to use SVN on a school project, I actually took a liking of it, and it had become my default VCS. However, I really did enjoy Git, so I came back to it. To not let it go again.


## Spacemacs

This is Vim + Emacs, what else would I need? 


## Zsh + iTerm2

Best. Combination. Ever.

It's way too well integrated with OS X, besides, it's just beautiful. The colours, the syntax highlight, I can know if a command is on my Path by simple typing its name, if it becomes green, it's there.

When a command give a way too large output and I want to go back up there, I simply type ⌘ + SHIFT + ↑, and there I am, navigating between commands.


## Music Folder

And at last, but not least, one of my most important belongings: Music. I listen to whatever, I do, however, enjoy Metal, and Metal, like *waaay* too much Metal. Even so, my favourite music is not Metal, but Classic.


## Conclusion

So, what about your workspace?
